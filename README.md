# VisualMedia

This is my take at remaking some of my renaming scripts from Python in C#, now with a GUI!

This program will help format your media by refactoring annoying names and stripping out rubbish.

**EDIT: ** Known issue is if the file name contains a year in it the program will added parenthesis around it as if it was the year of release

## All of the magic happens in Window.cs
